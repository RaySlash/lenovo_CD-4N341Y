Description:
The NetBSD version of the UNIX grep tool.
Allows easy searching for regexes.

Local Modifications:
- Removed the manpage (4-clause BSD licensed, everything else is
  2-clause per file headers)
- Removed -F option (which breaks POSIX, but requires regex options we
  don't support).
- Use grepfgetln() to substitute for fgetln(), which we don't have.
