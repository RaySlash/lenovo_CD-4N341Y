***OVERVIEW***
The font config library operates on a font cache file to do font queries, etc.
This cache file is built/generated off of the font files in the directory
"Font directory list" in fonts.conf, and the cache file is subsequently stored
in "Font cache directory list" in fonts.conf. When the font config library is
initialized, it checks if a cache file exists and then performs some checks to
make sure the file is valid. If those conditions are not met, it generates the
cache file on the spot. This generation can be expensive (~8 seconds), so we
are deploying a prebuilt cache file to the device as part of the OTA package.


***DIRECTORIES/FILES***
complete: Contains prebuilt font cache generated off of all font files.

minimalist: Contains prebuilt font cache generated off of small subset of font
files. This gets used for platforms that define USE_MINIMALIST_FONTS.

3830d5c3ddfd5cd38a049b759396e72e-le64.cache-4 (or something similar): Actual
prebuilt font cache file.

font_setup.sh: Copies the prebuilt cache file to the proper directory before
cast_shell starts up.

***MODIFYING FONT FILES***
IMPORTANT: IF YOU ADD/ERASE/UPDATE FONT FILES IN usr/share/fonts YOU NEED TO
REGENERATE THE PREBUILT CACHE FILE AND CHECK IT INTO THE REPO!

***REGENERATING CACHE FILE***
There will be an integration test that checks if the prebuilt cache file needs
to be regenerated. See test for reasons why it would need regenerating. Note
that the font config library will just generate the cache file on the spot if
it detects an outdated/corrupt cache file; it will just take a long time.
TODO(esum): Add name of integration test here once it's made.

When you do need to regenerate the cache file:
The cache file should get generated on the platform it will be used on, so it
has to be pulled from the device after cast_shell generates it:
1) Push new OTA to device containing any font updates.
2) After system has booted up, rm /data/chrome/fontconfig/*
3) Restart cast_shell (don't reboot), and wait for it to fully start.
4) The new cache file should be in /data/chrome/fontconfig. You can adb pull it
   to the proper directory on your desktop and commit it. Current repo location:
   vendor/eureka/fonts/(complete|minimalist)
